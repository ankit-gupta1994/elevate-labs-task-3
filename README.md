SQL Project on Online Book Store.

Data analysis is done on an "Online Book Store" using MySQL.

1) Created the database from scratch and then created the 3 tables: books, customers, and orders.
2) Used "Data Table Import Wizard" to input the data from the CSV file to the database.
3) Wrote multiple SQL queries to extract and analyze the data from the database.

The SQL file attached contains the questions for data analysis and their SQL queries to fetch the asked question.
Uploaded all the 3 tables in the table.zip file
Uploaded all the screenshots of the query output to the queries_output.zip file.
